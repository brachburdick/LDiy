# LDiy 0.4
An open source lighting desk and previz software.<br>
Designed to be accessible by anyone. No LD experience required to get started. <br>
Intuitive, accessible, and hardware agnostic.<br>
Inspired by EnviralDesign's [GeoPix](https://www.geopix.io/) & the [Open Lighting Project](https://www.openlighting.org).<br>
A [12South Entertainment](https://12southband.com) product.<br>

# Current Status
The TouchDesigner-based prototype works very well. Unfortunately, users will need a TD licence ([available for free!](https://derivative.ca/download/archive)) and a decent gpu to view/interact with this prototype. Due to this inaccessibility, I've shifted focus toward a [browser-native](www.ldiy.live) alternative. The site's up & running and ready for integration with the TD version's more powerful features. I'm finalizing my browser port of [node-dmx](https://github.com/node-dmx) to include other open-source dmx interfaces. 

# The Vision
Running a stage shouldn't require years of experience.<br>
LDIY is meant to provide automatic setup, previs, patching, mapping, & routing. <br>
I'm currently working on audWatcher for ai-assisted autogenertion of cues for timecoding.<br>
A comprehensive tutorial will be added soon.<br>


# TouchDesigner:
Current version of the application runs on TouchDesigner v2021.16410.<br>
